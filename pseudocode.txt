- create an empy file named outputSrollSaw.txt. Later, sequences that passed through the ScrollSaw script will be added to this file.
- define several functions that will be needed later
  - define a function to write a list to a text file. If the file already exists, overwrite it.
  - define a function to append a list to an existing text file
  - define a function adding the following information for each sequence to the file: sequence name, number of values, and individual values from the input file (output file from the TreePuzzle program)
  - define a function to generate a file containing the set of minimal pairs and corresponding distance values
- using Intertool, generate a list with all possible pairs of taxonomic groups. Numbers are used as group names. The groups are numbered from 00 to, e.g., 03.
- process each pair from the list generated by Intertool, do the following:
  - generate the input file name. It's the file generated by TreePuzzle for each taxonomic pair (e.g., 00_01.phy.dist). This file has to be provided for the ScrollSaw script. The file contains the number of sequences on the first line and then sequence names and genetic distance values. The order of the values is the same as the order of the sequences in the file.
  - work with the file (e.g., 00_01.phy.dist) as described in the next steps:
  - create a list containing the names of all sequences in the file 00_01.phy.dist. Follow the order of sequences. This will enable to assign a sequence name to a particular value according to its order.
  - read the first line containing the number of sequences. Check if it matches the number of sequences in the list containing all names from the previous step. Print the number of sequences and result of the number check.
  - define a function "lowest" which can detect the lowest value and name of the corresponding sequence name. 
  - for each sequence, read individual values and store them in the list called values. Add them to the text file values.txt. Using function lowest, determine the lowest value and its position. Using the list containing all the names, detect which sequence name corresponds to the position. Verify that both sequences belong to different taxonomy groups. If not, continue the search. Add names and corresponding values to the dictionary named result.
  - export result dictionary as a text file named 0001minima.txt. The numbers at the beginning of the name of the file correspond to the assessed taxonomic group, 00 and 01 in the first evaluated file.
  - open created file (0001minima.txt) and generate individual pairs to MinimaPairs dictionary.
  - detect sequences that form reciprocal minimal pairs. Add them to the dictionary named SSresult.
- repeat these steps for all distance matrix files
- determine the total number of sequences that passed the ScrollSaw script and print the number.
- remove duplicate sequence names, determine the total number of unique sequences and print it.
- save the list of unique sequences that passed ScrollSaw to the file outputScrollSaw.txt
- delete the file containing values.txt
